# FediSqueak

A fediverse client made primarily for use with GoToSocial instances.  
Build in React Native for iOS and Android.  
Very much work in progress.

## Reasoning

Most clients available for mobile devices are made primarily for use with Mastodon. This leads to annoying bugs when encountering the things
that GoToSocial does differently than Mastodon.  
Also, my favourite Mastodon client seems to no longer be in active development, so I can not hope that its developer fixes any bugs in it, no
matter if they relate to GoToSocial or not.

## Naming

Why FediSqueak?  
Because my previous favourite fediverse client [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451) is named after the sound a Mastodon
would make, which makes sense considering it is primarily intended for use with Mastodon.  
Since everything written in Go must have a Gopher as its mascot, I thought I'd name my client after the sound those make.  
The fact that GoToSocial breaks with the norm and has a sloth as its mascot did not impact this application's naming.
